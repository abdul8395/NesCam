                                    Many states make their Construction Site camera footage publicly available in real-time.
                                    We tap into those video streams to capture, catalog and archive video hour by hour.

                                    States typically do not record their Construction Site camera footage.

                                <p class="answer">
                                    We store video as MPEG-4 (MP4). This format yields high quality video at reasonable file sizes.
                                    Should you have any trouble playing your video with your device's built in media player,
                                    we recommend <a href="index-1.htm" target="_blank">VLC Player</a>, a free and robust media application.

                                <p class="answer">
                                    Some videos may not play well with your device's built in media player so we recommend 
                                    <a href="index-1.htm" target="_blank">VLC Player</a>, a free and robust media application.
                                    You can generally tell if your video is corrupt by flashing colors, white noise and other visual anomalies.
                                    In the case of truly corrupted video, you may be eligible for a refund. <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> for assistance.

                                <p class="answer">
                                    We start and stop video capture on the hour and capture as much video as possible for each camera. 
                                    At times, the video streams drop momentarily which causes gaps in the final video and yields video shorter than an hour.
                                    This typically occurs when a camera's network experiences instability.
                                    When video is more than a few minutes short of an hour, we warn you and require confirmation before video can be added to your cart.
                                </p>

                                <p class="answer">
                                    When browsing for video, we make it easy to view real-time video from the cameras.
                                    The video is streamed directly from the state and at times their infrastructure malfunctions or is down for maintenance.
                                    Sometimes the video is streamed over self signed SSL which some browsers reject (e.g. FireFox).

                                <p class="answer">
                                    We encode our archived videos with metadata that describes the location and time frame.
                                    You can view this data by opening the properties of the video file within your operating system or video player.

                                <p class="answer">
                                    We record a hash for every video we archive and save purchased videos for at least a year.
                                    We will provide hash values for videos you have purchased as needed. <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> for more information.

                                    When browsing cameras, you will see a share button on the bottom right of the map.
                                    Click that button to obtain a URL that you can send to a colleague.
